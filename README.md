In this exercise, the JavaScript code utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to create an interactive effect with pupils on a webpage. The JavaScript code creates a dynamic effect where two elements with the class 'ball' on the webpage move in response to the user's mouse movement, creating an interactive and visually engaging experience.

No installation or setup instructions.

This project can be used to learn:
1) The code uses document.getElementsByClassName('ball') to select all elements with the class 'ball' and stores them in the balls variable.
2) The document.onmousemove event handler is set up to respond to mouse movements on the document.
3) A loop iterates over the 'ball' elements (presumably, there are at least two), and their style.left and style.top properties are updated to reflect the calculated x and y values. This visually positions the 'balls' on the page based on mouse movement.
4) The transform property is used to apply a CSS transform to each 'ball', causing it to move in the opposite direction of the mouse. The translate function is employed for this purpose.

Please comment to leave general comments or questions.  You can suggest changes that I can apply directly from your comment.

Future iterations will include features to make it...

This is a work in progress.  Please feel free to expand and build upon the source code.  Feedback is welcome!
